Cursor

commands powershell console

New-Item -Path "options\options.css" -ItemType File
New-Item -Path "options\options.js" -ItemType File
New-Item -Path "options\options.html" -ItemType File

When selective capture is clicked, this error occurs
Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'CaptureOverlay' has already been declared (at capture-overlay.js:1:1)

Full page capture looks to be working but where does it store it. 

Screen recording does not do any action

New-Item -Path "background\screen-select.js" -ItemType File
New-Item -Path "background\screen-select.html" -ItemType File
New-Item -Path "background\screen-select.html" -ItemType File


The following changes are what I need to make
1) The Popup does not have Jarvis Icon. It needs to have a title Jarvis Helper with the logo.
2) The popup needs to stay in the same window and tab when initiated and needs to be showing up as a side bar on the right hand side.
3) this popup side bar needs to be collapsible but with some visibility .
4) The popup need to have 6 sections Screen Capture, Video Recording, Todo List , Save Bookmark, Help from AI, Data Google Docs/sheets
5) Use icons in src\icons to take action from user.
